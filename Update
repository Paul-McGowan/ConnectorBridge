The KEY provided by the app may be calculated inside the app from
already data available, the MAC address, TOKEN and such.
If I shut down data and WiFi on my phone the key is still displayed.
It may have cached this from the first time it was requested however.
The KEY appears to be a set of hex pairs seperated by dashes.
I have tried various permutations of MAC and TOKEN in an attempt to generate the
KEY, but have had no luck.
I have tried querying the hub with phrases such as 'GetDeviceKey',
'DeviceKey', but the hub stays silent.


The TOKEN returned by my hub is identical to the one shown in the API.
Are they all the same ?
The KEY shown by the app is different to that shown in the API however.
I'm giving up on the KEY now.
What we have works, even though we need another piece of sofware to generate
the KEY.
If someone else wants to look at it, please do !
