The KEY is calculated and assigned by 'Shade Connector' the company that provide the app.
There may be a way to retrieve a new key using your logon details to the app.
For now, it's eaiser to install the app, and tap the help screen as shown in the API
to retrieve the KEY.

The TOKEN returned by my hub is identical to the one shown in the API.
Are they all the same ?
