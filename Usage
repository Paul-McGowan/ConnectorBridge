This script allows you control blinds that are programmed into a Dooya Hub.

The only piece of data needed is the key generated by the 'controller' app.

Step 1. Retrieve the key
Install the 'controller' app on your mobile from the play store.
(BlocBlinds have their own app that mimics this, but doesn't have the 'key' feature.
You can saftely install the 'controller' app, retrieve the key, and uninstall it.)
Run this, and login with same details you use in your current app.
Go to the HELP and ABOUT page.
Now tap this page 5 times and a popup window appears.
Make a note of this string, it's your 'key'.
Close the app and exit.

Step 2. Edit the 'blind' script
Add the 'key' provided by the controller app
Name your blinds according to your household names.
Blinds must be added in the order in which they were programmed to your hub.
The hub knows them as 'mac address'+0001...0099 it doesn't use friendly names.

Run the script like this...

blind [name/all] [up/down/open/close/query/status/shuffle/0-100]

Running the script with no parameters displays the usage instructions and
data from the hub.

To open the study blind 50%
blind study 50

To query the patio blind
blind patio query

To open the patio blind
blind patio open

Shuffle picks a random percentage rounded to nearest 5% and is useful to stop blinds getting creased.

The script returns the postition of the blind and its battery status.

Renaming the script as 'dev' will run as normal, but will display lots of debuging data.
