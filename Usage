There are 3 Python scripts
discover - Get the mac address of the hub and the token
keygen - Generate the AccessToken form the app key and token
blind - script to control the blinds

You may need to install Pycrypto (sudo pip3 install pycrypto) for the keygen script

Step 1. Find the MAC address and Token
Run the discover script.
This will give the MAC address of your hub, together with the Token you need to generate the Access Token.


Step 2. Retrieve the key
Install the 'controller' app on your mobile from the play store.
(BlocBlinds have their own app that mimics this, but doesn't have the 'key' feature.
You can saftely install the 'controller' app, retrieve the key, and uninstall it.)
Run this, and login with same details you use in your current app.
Go to the HELP and ABOUT page.
Now tap this page 5 times and a popup window appears.
Make a note of this string, it's your 'key'.
Close the app and exit.
There may be a way to get this directly from the hub, but it's not documented in the API.


Step 3. Generate your Access Token
Edit the keygen script.
Add your 'token' from discover, into $data
Add the 'key' from the controller app into $key
Run this, and you will be given an "AccessToken"

Step 4. Edit the 'blind' script
Add your AccessToken and MAC address of your hub to the 'blind' script.
Name your blinds according to your household names.
Blinds must be added in the order in which they were programmed to your hub.
The hub knows them as 'mac address'+0001...0099 it doesn't use friendly names.

Run the script like this...

blind [name] [up/down/open/close/query/status/percentage]

To open the study blind 50%
blind study 50

To query the patio blind
blind patio query

To open the patio blind
blind patio open

The script returns the postition of the blind and its battery status.
